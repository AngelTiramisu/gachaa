Folders
=======

The script will give people a folder which is the name of the Easy Gacha object
followed by the date.

For example, if you name the object "My Stuff", then someone might receive a
folder that says:

    My Stuff (Easy Gacha 3 items 2013-10-06)

Other Stuff

Caveats / Assumptions
=====================

If the currently running script is deleted, the boot script won't auto-restart,
which means no scripts will be running. This can only be undone by deleting the
boot-script and re-adding it.

User/agent identification MUST be provided as UUID because SL has yet to
implement a way of looking up a UUID from a user-name or legacy-name reliably.
It might be possible to reverse engineer the key via site-scraping, but that's
not sustainable/maintainable and plain not worth it. We want llRequestAgentKey!
