# Instructions:

# List the items that you want people to receive from the Easy Gacha. Each item has a rarity.

# Each line should contain exactly two parts: Number Item

# The first part should be a POSITIVE number that is GREATER THAN ZERO. This is the rarity for this object. The higher the number, the more common it is. The exact percentage is based on dividing this number by the sum of all of the numbers. The script will tell you the percentages once you run it.

# You MUST have a SINGLE SPACE between the first part and the second part!

# The second part is the NAME of the inventory item. It must be an EXACT MATCH.

# Empty lines and lines which begin with a "#" will be ignored.
