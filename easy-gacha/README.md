Easy Gacha
==========

This is a very configurable implementation of a [Gashapon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gashapon)-style device.

Folders
=======

The script will give people a folder which is the name of the Easy Gacha object
followed by the date.

For example, if you name the object "My Stuff", then someone might receive a
folder that says:

    My Stuff (Easy Gacha 3 items 2013-10-06)

Configuration
=============

Two things are required to make it work:
1. The "Easy Gacha" script
2. The "Easy Gacha Config" notecard

Here are the steps to create your own Easy Gacha

Step 1
------

Create an object (or use an existing object for which you have mod rights).

Step 2
------

Copy the "Easy Gacha Config" notecard into your object. Open the notecard from
within the object and follow the instructions there. You should list each
inventory item you want to sell, and each person you wish to pay. Make sure you
define at least one payout (probably to yourself).

Step 3
------

Copy the "Easy Gacha" script into the object. If the script tells you there are
problems... follow the instructions to fix them!

Step 4
------

...

Step 5
------

Profit!

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why aren't the permissions more open?
-------------------------------------

Because otherwise I cannot vouch for its safety. If I made the script
modifiable, someone with ill intent could make it steal money, then give it
away. It would still list me as the creator, but would be malicious.

The script you have should have been created by:
[Zan Lightfoot](secondlife:///app/agent/d393638e-be6e-4f81-a44d-072e344828c4/about)

Also, if I made the objects modifiable and transferable, someone could put
something malicious inside them and they'd still list me as the creator.
Because the kit is free and the source code is open, there should be no problem
with each person that wants one ordering a free copy from the marketplace.

If you want your notecards and your gacha-box to be transferable, simply create
your own objects and notecards (copy the contents from mine) and set the
permissions how you please. The script is transferable because it is no-mod.

Where do I go for help?

You may contact me and I will probably help out, but I cannot guarantee a quick
(or any) response. This was a labor of love. There is no official support, and
Second Life comes... second.  Please read the license.
