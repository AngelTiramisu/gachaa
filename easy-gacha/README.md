Easy Gacha
==========

This is a very configurable implementation of a [Gashapon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gashapon)-style device.

Folders
=======

The script will give people a folder which is the name of the Easy Gacha object
followed by the date.

For example, if you name the object "My Stuff", then someone might receive a
folder that says:

    My Stuff (3 items on 2013-10-06)

Configuration
=============

Three things are required to make it work:
1. The "Easy Gacha" script
2. The "Easy Gacha Inventory" notecard
3. The "Easy Gacha Payout" notecard

Here are the steps to create your own Easy Gacha

Step 1
------

Create an object (or use an existing object for which you have mod rights).

Step 2
------

Copy the "Easy Gacha Inventory" notecard into your object. Open the notecard
from within the object and follow the instructions there. You should list each
inventory item you want to sell.

Step 3
------

Copy the "Easy Gacha Payout" notecard into your object. Open the notecard from
within the object and follow the instructions there. Make sure you define at
least one payout (probably to yourself).

Step 4
------

Copy the "Easy Gacha" script into the object. If the script tells you there are problems... follow the instructions to fix them!

Step 5
------

Step 6

Profit!
