Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What happens if someone pays too much?
--------------------------------------

Easy Gacha will give them change.

What happens if someone pays too little?
----------------------------------------

Easy Gacha will refund the whole amount given and remind them of the price.

Why aren't the permissions more open?
-------------------------------------

Because otherwise I cannot vouch for its safety. If I made the script
modifiable, someone with ill intent could make it steal money, then give it
away. It would still list me as the creator, but would be malicious.

The script you have should have been created by:
[Zan Lightfoot](secondlife:///app/agent/d393638e-be6e-4f81-a44d-072e344828c4/about)

Also, if I made the objects modifiable and transferable, someone could put
something malicious inside them and they'd still list me as the creator.
Because the kit is free and the source code is open, there should be no problem
with each person that wants one ordering a free copy from the marketplace.

If you want your notecards and your gacha-box to be transferable, simply create
your own objects and notecards (copy the contents from mine) and set the
permissions how you please. The script is transferable because it is no-mod.

Where do I go for help?
-----------------------

You may contact me and I will probably help out, but I cannot guarantee a quick
(or any) response. This was a labor of love. There is no official support, and
Second Life comes... second.  Please read the license.
